# AnimalEmotionDetection
The project aims to provide an intuitive user interface to predict the emotions of animals from images. Users can load an image of animals, and the application uses a trained deep learning model to predict the emotions of each animal in the image. The predicted emotions are displayed in a pop-up notification.
